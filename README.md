```bash
docker-compose up
```

3. Run services:

You can also run single service with nx:

4. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/promotion/health to check is it working.

5. Try also http://127.0.0.1:8000/promotion/all. This should return empty array as you don't have any promotions in db.

```bash
nx serve promotion-service
```
